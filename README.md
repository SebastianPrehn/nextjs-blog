# My Personal Website
This is the repository containing the source code for my personal website.

It was created using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and
is running both my blog, along with my primary portfolio on the internet.

## The Journey (Monthly Projects JAN/2022)
It was originally set up as part of my [Monthly Projects](https://github.com/SebastianPrehn/monthly-projects), and I learned quite a lot.


I originally wanted to create my website with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), but decided that I wanted something a bit more interesting, as it was my chance to delve into web development, which I had never done before. I found [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) from seeing [Spencer Woo](https://spencerwoo.com)'s website, and felt inspired to try to build my own. I highly recommend checking out his website if you're interested in web development.


I learned about the following:
- I learned a bit more HTML/CSS, and was introduced to proper JavaScript code for the first time.
- I learned about Next.js


## Resources
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and its [tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=homepage-cta&utm_campaign=next-website).
